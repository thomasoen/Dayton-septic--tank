# README

This will be my first project made in the rails system. I am creating a site for a 
[septic cleaning](http:/www.septictankdayton.com) service in the local area. I am hoping this will be the first successful program that will help my client

I have more experience in dealing with the people in the area than actually 
using the RAILS system. This is especially true for septic tank companies in 
Dayton Ohio and Xenia Ohio. 

I usually would build my sites in weebly or wordpress for my local septic tank 
company in Dayton or the Springfield. This is a test to see how Rails and Ruby would work and how it would affect my SEO rankings.  The site I am trying to rank now it's been a lot harder than I expected. Getting him leads on a consistent basis has a bit of a struggle and the phones are not ringing as much as they should be. 

SEPTIC PUMPING - importance of the phrase

I have been working with a local septic tank company and so far he has been a great guy to work with. He has an established [septic pumping](http:/www.septictankdayton.com) business that his grandfather had started. I was able to get him some leads organically, but have not had much luck with google adwords or bing adwords. 

Hoping to get better rankings that will lead to more phone calls for my client.
